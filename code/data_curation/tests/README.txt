### Manual tests done to ensure that the data join between news releases and pair exchange is well-done
### Lot of effort was put here, as itÂ´s key to ensure that market movements were due to macro-economic data
### releases.
### Worth to remind that we are analysing short-term impact, so a deviation in minutes (as those originated by
### DTS ) could ruin our models.
