## Abstract <a name="abstract"> </a>
The reason we want to use the Forex Factory calendar is to know when market-moving news are expected and thereby avoid or prepare for periods of high volatility.

## Data sources <a name="data"></a>
Two publicly available data sources have been used as sources of raw data:
- **Forex related macro-economic news events, scrapped from [forexfactory](https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar.php)**

    Forex Factory calendar is one of the most accurate calendars to keep track of Forex-related news events.
Unfortunatelly, forexfactory does not facilitate any mechanism to download this historical data from their website, so a dedicated scrapper had to be developed for such a purpose.

    Once ran the scrapper, a file is created with the following information:
    
    | Field | Description | Format
    | ------ | ------ | -------
    | country | Country that publishes the new. | 3-letter abbreviation of the country, e.g., USD
    | datetime | Date and time of publication. | yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss, e.g., 2018-10-21 00:00:00
    | impact | Forexfactory classification for the expected impact of this release in the market. | <High\|Low\|Medium>
    | new | Name of the new. | String, e.g., Unemployment Rate
    | forecast | Forecasted value agreed by the economic experts and analytics. | 5%
    | actual | Actual value officially published by the goverment. ItÂ´s worth mentioning that each new could have a different range of values. For instance, unemployment rates are published in %, e.g., 5%. However, other news are published in thousands or millions, as 'Unemployment Claims', which could have a value of 210k. Thus, this field will require some pre-procesing as explained later.<br>Lower or higher actual values do not mean better or worse. If we look at GDP numbers, for example, a higher number is generally seen as more positive for an economy and, by so, the strength of its currency. If we look at unemployment data, a lower number is positively interpreted as it shows the economy of the country is improving.| 4% or 210K or 30B or 0.1
    | forecast_error | Flag that indicates whether the actual value was better or worse for the economy than the forecasted one.   | <better\|worse\|accurate>
    | previous | Actual value of the previous release for this same new.| e.g. 3%
    | previous_error | Flag that indicates whether the previous value was corrected on this release or not. If corrected, the flag indicates whether the corrected value was better or worse for the economy than the forecasted one.  | <better\|worse\|accurate>
    | week | week of the year. | From 1 to 52

- **Historical EUR-USD exchange rate, downloaded from [dukascopy](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/)**

    The exchange price for the EUR-USD pair was downloaded from dukascopy, in candlesticks of 5 minutes.

    | Field | Description | Format
    | ------ | ------ | -------
    | Gmt time | timestamp in GMT | dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm:ss.000, e.g. 01.01.2007 00:00:00.000
    | Open | enchange rate when the candle opened | e.g. 1.31908
    | High | highest exchange rate for that candle | e.g. 1.31961
    | Low | lowest exchange rate for that candle  | e.g. 1.31896
    | Close | enchange rate when the candle closed | e.g. 1.31947
    | Volume | Volume of transactions done on that period | e.g. 5268.6


## Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>
The picture belows illustrates the methodology followed for this project:


- **Phase-1: Obtain raw data from publicly available sources**

    As explained above, data from forexfactory was obtained using our own scrapper whilst data from dukascopy was downloaded from their website.   
    Raw data is uploaded to the repo, to /data/raw/   
    Data from forexfactory was obtained running the scrapper this way:

    ```sh
    $ cd code/scrappers
    $ python forexfactory_scraper.py calendar.php?week=oct14.2006 calendar.php?week=dec23.2018 52 ../../data/raw/
    ```
- **Phase-2: Getting familiar with the data**   

    Before extracting features from the raw data, we did an exploratory analysis on the raw data to understand it better: /code/data_curation/data_familiarity.ipynb.
Main observations:
    * Some news are published in %, whilst others in Millions, Billions, Thousands, etc. We would need to normalize that.
    * For USD, news are more or less evenly distributed between High, Medium and Low. For instance, for 2017, 22 High news were published, 27 Medium and 29 Low.
    * There are news published as having "High" impact sometimes and "Medium" impact others, like "Unemployment Claims"
    * forexfactory.com publishes non-accurate forecasts around 2/3 of the times
    * There are news published in 'bundle', this is, at exactly the same date and time. This occurs about 30% of the times.   

- **Phase-3: Feature engineer**

    Raw data was processed to generate features of interest for the models.
In essence, our models aim to predict the market reaction to news events, so we needed to incorporate market features to our dataframe:

    The most relevant observations to mention here would be:
    * Both dataframes were converted to the same timezone 
Forexfactory was scrapped in US/Eastern with DST off and dukascopy provides its data in GMT.
    * Handle Daylight Saving Times (DST)
Forexfactory stores the data without accounting for DST (as explained in the code), so we needed to add +1h whenever applicable.
    * A significant amount of time was spent to sanity check a proper merge of both dataframes by datetime.
This could sound like an easy task, but it was very time-consuming. We needed to ensure that dukascopy was alligned with forexfactory so that the data going into the models reflected the same market reaction as the one observed in the forexfactory website. The goal of our project is to predict short-term impact, so a deviation in minutes (as those originated by DST ) could ruin our models.   
   
        *As a curiosity, our first data source for exchange rates was forexite.com, but we had to change to dukascopy exactly because of this same reason*
    
        ```sh
        $ cd code/data_curation
        $ python dc_forexfactory.py 2007 2018  ../../data/raw/ forexfactory_ USD EURUSD [5,10,15,20,25,30] [0,30,60] [30,60,120,180,240] ON ../../data/curated/ features dc_forexfactory.log
        ```
    
New most-relevant features created 
    
    | Field | Description | Format
    | ------ | ------ | -------
    |year| year when the new was published | yyyy, e.g. 2018
    |weekday| weekday | 0: Monday - 6: Sunday
    |forecast_error_diff| difference between actual and forecast | float
    |forecast_error_diff_deviation| ratio between forecast_error_diff and the standard deviation of this difference for the previous 5 events | float
    |forecast_error_diff_outlier_class| numeric field indicating whether forecast_error_diff was an outlier or not  | 0: within Q1 <br> Q3, 1: Out of the Q1 - Q3 range but still not an outlier <br> 2: Outlier <br> 3: Extreme Outlier
    |previous_error_diff| difference between previous and actual (from previous release) | float
    |previous_error_diff_deviation| ratio between previous_error_diff and the standard deviation of this difference for the previous 5 events | float
    |previous_error_diff_outlier_class| numeric field indicating whether previous_error_diff was an outlier or not  | 0: within Q1 <br> Q3, 1: Out of the Q1 - Q3 range but still not an outlier <br> 2: Outlier <br> 3: Extreme Outlier
    |volatility_60_0_**before**| volatility, i.e. (high - low), one hour before the publication of the new | integer 
    |pips_agg_60_0_**before**| pips variation in the EURUSD exchange pair, calculated as (close - open), one hour before the publication of the new | integer 
    |volatility_X_Y_**after**| volatility, i.e. (high - low), of the window X-Y, meassured in minutes. <br> E.g. volatility_0_30_after holds the volatility 30 minutes after the new is release, volatility_30_60_after holds the volatility between 30 and 60 minutes, etc. <br> We are referring to X_Y for the sake of simplicity, as the dataframe will contain as many windows as requested by the user | integer 
    |pips_candle_X_Y_**after**| pips variation in the EURUSD exchange pair, calculated as (close - open), of the window X-Y | integer 
    |pips_agg_X_Y_**after**| pips variation in the EURUSD exchange pair, calculated as (close - open), since the new was released, i.e. the interval 0_Y | integer 
    |pips_candle_max_X_Y_**after**| maximum pips variation in the EURUSD exchange pair, calculated as (high - open), of the window X-Y | integer 
    |pips_candle_min_X_Y_**after**| minimum pips variation in the EURUSD exchange pair, calculated as (low - open), of the window X-Y | integer
